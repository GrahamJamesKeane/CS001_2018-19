# Question 1

# Create variable day and assign value Thursday, then assign 32.5, and then assign 19
day = "Thursday"

day = 32.5

day = 19

# print variable day
print(day)

# Output of print(day) will be 19 as the variable, day, has had its value replaced from
# the string "Thursday", to the float 32.5, to the int 19
